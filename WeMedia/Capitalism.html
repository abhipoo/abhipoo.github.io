<h3>Capitalism</h3>

<p>Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.[1][2][3][4] Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets.[5][6] In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets</p>

<h3>Arguments against Capitalism</h3>
<p>Buy, sell, sell, buy, buy more, super discount, offers, cashbacks, payday means spend day !

We have got stuck in an endless cycle of earning and spending. Marketing is all around us. Our inboxes are full of promotional emails notifying us about the best deals. 

We are chasing endless profits without thinking about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/705418.The_Limits_to_Growth">sustainability and effects on our environment (limits to growth)</a>. Individual benefits are valued more than the common good. People in favour of capitalism justify this by arguing that acting for your personal gains is the best way to serve the society (Ayn rand / Adam smith's invisible hand). You can believe this if you choose to ignore the economic gap between the rich and poor.
